# Kotlin/SpringBoot GPT API Wrapper

This project is a simple Kotlin/SpringBoot wrapper for the OpenAI GPT `/completions` API. It is designed to make it easy for developers to interact with the GPT API using Kotlin and SpringBoot.

## Features

- Supports the `text-davinci-003` model (latest available for free users)
- Costs $0.02 per 1000 tokens (1 token is approximately 1.2 words)
- Accepts a Git repository name that the PAT (Personal Access Token) has permission to access and generates the technology stack in JSON format.
